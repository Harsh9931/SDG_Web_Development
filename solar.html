        <h1><strong>Solar Energy</strong></h1>
        <div>
          Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or
          electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant
          renewable energy source available in the world. Solar technologies can
          harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating
          electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment,
          and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.
        </div>
      </section>

        <h1>Solar Technologies</h1>
        <p>
          There are three main ways to harness solar energy: photovoltaics,
          solar heating & cooling, and concentrating solar power. Photovoltaics
          generate electricity directly from sunlight via an electronic process
          and can be used to power anything from small electronics such as
          calculators and road signs up to homes and large commercial
          businesses. Solar heating & cooling (SHC) and concentrating solar
          power (CSP) applications both use the heat generated by the sun to
          provide space or water heating in the case of SHC systems, or to run
          traditional electricity-generating turbines in the case of CSP power
          plants.

        <h1>How solar is used</h1>
        <img id="solar_pic"  src="./assets/Solar_Energy.png" style= "width=500px;">
        <p>
          Solar power harnesses energy from the sun through two primary methods:
          photovoltaic (PV) systems and solar thermal systems. Photovoltaic
          systems convert sunlight directly into electricity using semiconductor
          materials that exhibit the photovoltaic effect. These systems range
          from small rooftop installations to large solar farms. Solar thermal
          systems, on the other hand, utilize sunlight to heat a fluid, which
          then generates steam to drive a turbine and produce electricity
        </p>
        <p>
          Advanced solar technologies can also incorporate battery storage,
          allowing the captured energy to be stored and used even when the sun
          isn't shining. This combination of generation and storage ensures a
          consistent and reliable energy supply. Solar power, integrated with
          other renewable sources, forms a resilient and sustainable energy
          infrastructure worldwide. The expansion of solar power relies on
          ongoing innovation and supportive policies to promote widespread
          adoption and ensure access to clean energy for all.
