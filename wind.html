        <p>
          Wind energy is the process of generating electricity using the wind,
          or the movement of air through the Earth's atmosphere. It is a
          renewable and clean source of energy that can help reduce dependence
          on fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wind energy is actually a byproduct of the sun. The sun‚Äôs uneven
          heating of the atmosphere, the earth‚Äôs irregular surfaces (mountains
          and valleys), and the planet's revolution around the sun all combine
          to create wind. Since wind is in plentiful supply, it‚Äôs a sustainable
          resource for as long as the sun‚Äôs rays heat the planet.

        <h2>How Wind Energy works:</h2>
        <img id="wind_working" src="./assets/wind_turbine.png" alt="wind_turbine_pic" />
        <p>
          Wind turbines work on a simple principle: instead of using electricity
          to make wind‚Äîlike a fan‚Äîwind turbines use wind to make electricity.
          Wind turns the propeller-like blades of a turbine around a rotor,
          which spins a generator, which creates electricity.
          <br><br>
          Wind is a form of solar energy caused by a combination of three concurrent events:
            <ul>
                <li>The sun unevenly heating the atmosphere</li>
                <li>Irregularities of the earth's surface</li>
                <li>The rotation of the earth.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases. The difference in air pressure across the two sides of the blade creates both lift and drag. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag and this causes the rotor to spin. The rotor connects to the generator, either directly (if it‚Äôs a direct drive turbine) or through a shaft and a series of gears (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator. This translation of aerodynamic force to rotation of a generator creates electricity.

        <h2>Types of Wind Turbines</h2>
        
        <p>
            Mostly wind turbines fall into two basic types:
            <h4>Horizontal-Axis Turbines</h4>
            <img id="turbine" src="./assets/horizontal_turbine.jpg" alt="horizontal_turbine_img">
            <br>
            <p>Horizontal-Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, making them the most common type of wind turbines, typically used in large-scale wind farms. These turbines are highly efficient in consistent wind conditions and benefit from extensive research and development. However, they require a yaw mechanism to turn the blades toward the wind, adding to their complexity. HAWTs generally have larger and more intricate structures compared to their vertical-axis counterparts.</p>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4>vertical-Axis Turbines</h4>
            <img id="turbine" src="./assets/vertical_turbine.jpg" alt="vertical_turbine_img">
            <br>
            <p>Vertical-Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT) have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, allowing them to capture wind from any direction without needing a yaw mechanism. This design makes them particularly suitable for turbulent wind conditions, such as those found in urban areas. VAWTs are easier to maintain since their generator and gearbox are located closer to the ground. However, they are generally less efficient than HAWTs and are limited by the height and length of their blades, making them more suitable for small-scale applications.</p>
